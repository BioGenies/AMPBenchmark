Each of heat maps represents an architecture, the x- and y-axis describe the training and benchmark method of negative data sampling, respectively. Each architecture was trained and benchmarked on five replicates of the training and benchmark sample. The mean value of AUC for the five replicates is indicated as shades of red, orange and yellow, and the standard deviation as black dots of varying sizes. The diagonals mark results for architectures trained and benchmarked on the data generated by the same sampling method.
